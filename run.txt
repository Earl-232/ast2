Q5:
| Generate Ground Truths, Actions for world:
-------
Generates folders containg the graphs and actions for each world.
USAGE:
0.) Ensure anaconda is in $PATH and environement set
1.) python3 g_truth.py 

| Display World and Actions(HeatMap):
-------
**Ensure anaconda/python3 is in the current $PATH on the ilab machine
For ilab use the following commands to add anaconda to path.
	
    $ export PATH="$PATH:/koko/system/anaconda/bin"
	$ source activate python38


USAGE:
0.) Ensure anaconda is in $PATH, and environment active
1.) Run make
2.) python3 main.py 
3.) select world, and then desired action in top left drop-down
4.) slect 'run' under actions and use the arrows to go through
    each action. (see 'DETAILS' for details about visualization)
DETAILS:
The top highlights what action and sensor reading you are presently
occupying. Additionally, the grid is color cordinate to display:
white,blue,red,and dark red cells. White being the lowest, and dark red
being high probability.

| Show Probability Plot
-------
You can adjust the # of experiments and # of actions in calc_agent_prob.py file

USAGE:
0.) Ensure anaconda is in $PATH and environement set
1.) python3 calc_agent_prob.py graphs results


| Show Error Plot
-------
You can adjust the # of experiments and # of actions in the filter_err.py file

USAGE:
0.) Ensure anaconda is in $PATH and environement set
1.) Generate graphs & results (see Generate Ground Truths, Actions for world)
2.) python filter_err.py graphs results


Q7:
| Show Intermediate Optimal Utilities 

USAGE:
0.) Ensure anaconda is in $PATH and environement set
1.) python3 val_iterate.py

NOTES:

Interpreting Optimal Policy Array
- To interpret a policy of a state, given A[], its optimal policy, if 
we want the optimal policy of some state s2: pi*(s2) =  A[i-1] = A[2-1] = 
A[1].
- with an inital discountfactor of 0.9, our original utilities are all initlized to zero, and updated 
each iteration.

RESULTS:
Computationally, we get a run time of 0.136s, and a takes 124 iterations to get us a policy of [2,2,3,1]
